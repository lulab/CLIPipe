This is a Linux 32-bit binary. 
 
Install the file "phylogibbs-mp" in the "program" subdirectory into
a directory of your choice (say "$HOME"/bin), set your path 
accordingly and run it.

Manual pages are in phylogibbs_1.html and
phylogibbs_algorithm_7.html (html versions) and phylogibbs.1 and
phylogibbs_algorithm.1 (Unix man pages).

The "Examples" directory is currently empty, but read the manual
and the notes.

If you have previously used PhyloGibbs 1.0, there are significant
differences and some of the commandline options have changed...

For any further help, contact me.
