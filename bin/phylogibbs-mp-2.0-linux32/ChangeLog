Changes made since PhyloGibbs-1.0:
General: removed usedimer and friends (thus, also removed one superfluous
     parameter in moveweight.[ch])
initroutines.c: remove if trackedbins then no-anneal stuff: take care of
	this in main.c
initroutines.c: add a default value for Ncolm if set to -1.
initroutines.c: change default wwidth back to 10 from 12.
parseopts.c, interspecies.h: added -W option (write only at end of anneal)
	(UPDATE - changed this to reverse its meaning)
parseopts.c, interspecies.h: added -v option (verbose)
	Now, default output to stdout is minimal progress information
	-q suppresses all output to stdout (stderr still reports errors)
	-v does old-style verbose output
parseopts.c: disallow negative values for betaincr, with warning

main.c : removed rNcolm rNwinm etc. v.Ncolm is never -1 after initroutines
	is done.
main.c : trackedbins was being cleaned up before the tracking phase 
     if it existed.  This is wrong obviously -- if it existed it was
     specified with -A.
main.c: if colour moves are specified, the estimates of Ncolm, Nwinm etc
     in initroutines may be inappropriate: scale them by new number of
     colours/windows after transient phase.
main.c: add progress bar.
main.c: randomise current state before tracking only when tracking an
    annealed cluster.  If tracking a supplied set of windows, we're 
    starting from an equilibriated state already. 

initwindows.c,interspecies.h,new files renumberwindowseqs.[ch]:
    There was some confusion of what the "seq" element of window means:
    originally it meant both the index of the sequence and the species
    index.  But when I allowed multiple alignments (like ">>") the
    second meaning broke.  I have now added a new window element "species"
    and a routine renumberwindowseqs() that initialises this from
    the seq element.

renumberwindowseqs.c: Optionally, the ->species field is initialised
	by matching labels (supplied via -l) with sequence headers.

setwinbasecount.c: Changed one instance of thisseq=g_array_index(win->seq,...)
    to thisseq=g_array_index(win->species,...).  Removed other, superfluous
    instances of thisseq etc.

initroutines.c: Do not pad v->seqmuset with v->nomutprob: take care of this
    in setwinbasecount.c

setwinbasecount.c: if thisseq is < v->seqmuset->len then thismu is 
    taken from seqmuset else it is set to v->nomutprob.

parseopts.c: Added -l option, changed return type from void to int
    (which it already was in parseopts.h)

main.c: if parseopts errors out, quit

parseopts.c, etc: changed meaning of -W to write at every cycle
    (changed default to only write at end).

new files commonroutines.[ch] : contains string-processing and other
  stuff that will be required by binprint.c, trackedbinprint.c and
  others.

trackedbinprint.c: changed weight matrix printout to new transfac-like
  format
binprint.c: include a weight-matrix printout with same format as in
  trackedbinprint.c

commonroutines.c, [tracked]binprint.c: small changes from Erik

manpage phylogibbs.1 : reorganisation into "essential" and "advanced"
  options, intro rewritten by Eric with small fixes from me, entries 
  for -H, -l, -G rewritten following Eric's ideas.

manpage phylogibbs_algorithm.7: several changes, brought up to date

Autoconf-ised the whole thing, moved all source files into src/ .
Moved README.first to README.  Created a file README.AUTOCONF
saying what the autoconf setup is about (not part of a distributed
tarball).

Added errorchecking for bases, fixed bugs in "-X = blocked base".

Made -D autodetect (if it sees a - character it assumes alignment).
-H or -G is still required for aligned sequence.

Changed -i to also initialise "direction" of initially selected
window, and added stricter errorchecking for bases.

New -L option to handle general phylogenies, with changes to
setwinbasecount.c and other places, and new files tree_routines.[ch]

Some bugfixes and memory leak plugs relating to -L (one of the memory
leaks was old but wasn't severe without -L).

New option -E (tracking cutoff).

New option -R (print site positions as negative numbers from end of
seq)
