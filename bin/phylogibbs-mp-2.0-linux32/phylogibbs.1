.TH PHYLOGIBBS-MP 1 "September 14, 2007"
.SH NAME
PhyloGibbs-MP v1.9-BETA \- Gibbs-sampling motif finder and cis-regulatory 
module predictor incorporating phylogeny and tracking statistics.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBphylogibbs \fI[options] inputfile1 [inputfile2 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
PhyloGibbs-MP searches for motifs in single or multiple DNA sequences, each
of which may be prealigned with homologous sequence from related
species.  It uses Gibbs sampling with an anneal+track strategy that
finds multiple motifs simultaneously and reports their
significance. The user needs to specify the phylogenetic tree of the
"proximities" between the species that occur in the input multiple
alignmnents (see examples below).  This manual page describes
PhyloGibbs-MP, which incorporates several extensions to PhyloGibbs.
.PP
This manual page describes the program's command-line options. For the
internal philosophy and description of the algorithm, see the
phylogibbs_algorithm(7) manpage. Below is a quick summary of the most
important options, followed by more detailed descriptions of all
options in alphabetical order.
.PP
Input sequences are read from a list of fasta files specified at the
end of the commandline.  (When compiled with GNU getopt or a
compatible implementation, the files may in fact be specified anywhere
in the command line.)  Alternatively, a single input file may be
specified by the \fB\-f\fR option, which exists only for backward
compatibility and may be removed in the future.  Sequences that are
not aligned with any other sequences may include the bases A, C, G, T,
degenerate IUPAC symbols, and the symbol X (blocking sites from
occurring at that position). The case of the symbols in unaligned
sequences is ignored. If sequences are phylogenetically related, they
must be in multi-fasta format, as output by Dialign or other multiple
alignment programs; they may contain uppercase or lowercase nucleotide
symbols A, C, G, T, dashes (-) to indicate gaps, and 'X' or 'x' to
indicate a blocked site. Vertically aligned uppercase letters are
treated as aligned and scored taking their phylogenetic relationship
into account. Lowercase letters are considered unaligned with other
sequences.
.PP
To run on multiple sets of multiple alignments, e.g. multiple
alignments of orthologous regulatory regions from the same set of
species, and when not using the \fB-d\fR option (discriminative motif
finding), the simplest way is to put each alignment in a separate file
and list all these files at the end of the command line (not using the
\fB\-f\fR option).  However, with the \fB-d\fR option enabled, motifs
are assumed to occur discriminatively in the specified files; if this is
not desired for a set of alignments, those alignments must be
specified in a single file.  When supplied in one file, the different
alignments are to be separated by using a double tick ">>" instead of
a single tick ">" on the header of the first species in each set.  For
example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
>>SpeciesA region 1
ACTGACataAGCAGAC...
>SpeciesB region 1
AGTCAC--aATCAGAT...
>>SpeciesA region 2 
CATCACATA--agaat...
>SpeciesB region 2 
CATCGCAAAaagcata...
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here, the two region 1 sequences from species A and species B are
aligned with each other, but are not aligned with the two region 2
sequences from species A and B, because of the separator ">>".
.PP
The interpretation of the input sequence is controlled by the \fB\-D
\fR option; 0 ignores phylogeny and treats all sequences as unaligned,
1 and 2 both assume phylogeny but with different degrees of strictness
regarding which alignment blocks can be considered candidate locations
for binding sites. The relation of the species to their common
ancestor must be specified using the \fB-L\fR or the \fB\-H\fR option
as described below (see also the advanced \fB\-G\fR option).
.PP                                                                      
Per default the best configuration of binding sites (obtained by
simulated annealing) is written to the file "output" and the posterior
probabilities of binding sites (obtained by tracking) are written to
"tracked_output". These filenames can be changed via the \fB\-o
\fIoutput_file\fR and \fB\-t \fItracking_file\fR options.  The width
of the sites is the same for all motifs and is set via \fB\-m
\fImotifwidth\fR. The "prior probability" that a site is a WM is given
by the \fB\-p\fR -- for example, \fB\-p\fR \fI0.01\fR (the default)
means one expects one binding site (regardless of type or "colour")
per 100 bp of sequence.  Note that this number should not be greater
than the reciprocal of the width of the site (\fB\-m\fR option) and
should in practice be much less.
.PP
Optionally, GBrowse-format annotations for the predictions can be
written to files specified via the \fB\-g\fR option.  At present, only
predictions for the "anchor species" (the first species in the
phylogeny parameters) are annotated to these files, and the headers
corresponding to this species must be formatted appropriately (see
below).  These annotations may then be uploaded to any GBrowse server.
.PP  
Fine-tuning is provided by a host of other options described in 
alphabetic order below; for many of these, proper usage will require 
an understanding of the internal strategy, as described in 
phylogibbs_algorithm(7).
.PP
.SH ESSENTIAL OPTIONS
These options must be understood in order to use Phylogibbs
effectively. Advanced options are described in the next section.
All options have short and long versions; use either version.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-dialign \fInum\fB
\fInum\fR specifies the "alignment level" of the input sequence and
may be 0, 1, 2.  If 0, assume input sequences are not aligned: this is
the default. If 1, assume they are aligned (Dialign-style aligned
fasta, or multi-fasta), and treat inconsistent windows
"flexibly". That is, when gaps occurs within a multi-species aligned
window, separate it into smaller windows (that is, windows containing
fewer species) that each contain mutually gapless subsets of
species. If 2, assume aligned sequences and be "strict" about windows
containing gaps: reject them (never place sites at their positions).
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-bgfile \fIfilename\fB
File (fasta format) to use for estimating the background
distribution. In typical cases, this file would consist of large
amounts of intergenic sequence from the species of interest. Default:
use the input file to calculate the background distribution.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a brief summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-L,\-\-labeltree \fIstring\fB
This is required to specify general phylogenies ("star topology"
phylogenies can be specified with \fB-H\fR, see below). The supplied
\fIstring\fR specifies the phylogenetic tree and must be complete and
correct.  The tree format that we use is the standard Newick
format. However, the values that are normally branch lengths are
instead "proximities" in our format. A proximity gives the probability
that no mutation has taken place along the branch. The names labelling
the leafs of the tree should correspond to a substring that occurs in
all fasta-headers of those input sequences that derive from this
species (and that does not occur in the fasta-headers of sequences
from other species). 

For example, the following phylogeny
.nf

                       0.85
                     -------- human
              0.6   |
          ----------+
         |          |  0.9
         |           -------- chimp
Ancestor +
         |             0.8
         |           -------- mouse
         |    0.7   |
          ----------+
                    |  0.9
                     -------- rat

.fi
would be written as 
.br
\fI\-L "((human:0.85,chimp:0.9):0.6,(mouse:0.8,rat:0.9):0.7)"\fR
.br
(the string is quoted to protect the parentheses from the shell).
Note that the proximities are between successive nodes or leaves: eg,
0.9 for chimp indicates that, for a given neutrally evolving base in
chimp, the probability of no substitutions in this base since the
common ancestor of chimp and human is 0.9. Proximities are
multiplicative: for example, if the set of aligned sequences in the
input does not actually contain the sequence for human, the
human-chimp node will be eliminated and chimp's proximity to the
common ancestor of all species in the tree will be 0.6x0.9 =
0.54. Thus, a single tree may be used that includes species not
occurring in the input data.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-modulesize \fInum1[,num2]\fR
PhyloGibbs-MP can restrict predictions to small unspecified regions of
a large input sequence, such as unknown cis-regulatory modules.  This
option accepts one or (optionally) two, comma-separated, integers,
\fInum1\fR and \fInum2\fR.
\fInum1\fR is the length of a module.  \fInum2\fR, if specified, is the
average spacing between two modules.  If \fInum2\fR is not specified,
each sequence may contain only one module, of length \fInum1\fR.  If
\fInum2\fR is specified, a sequence of length \fIL\fR may contain
at least one, but up to \fI(L+num2)/(num1+num2)\fR modules.
This means that on each input sequence (regardless of alignment
constraints) predictions must be restricted to such modules.  Eg, with
\fB\-l\fR \fI500\fR predicted sites on each sequence must fall within a
500bp stretch.  With \fB\-l\fR \fI500,500\fR, predicted sites on
sequences of length 1500bp must fall in two 500bp stretches.  If a
sequence has length less than \fInum1\fR, predicted sites may be
anywhere on that sequence.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-motifwidth \fInum\fB
Width of motifs to search for (integer). Default: 10.
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-ncorrel \fInum\fB
Order of the Markov model used for the background probabilities.  -1:
use background probabilities of 0.25 for each base. 0: use single
base counts. 1 or more: condition the probability of a background base
on the \fInum\fR bases immediately preceeding it. Default: 1. See
also the \fB\-F\fR and \fB\-P\fR options.

One can also supply a comma-separated list of four floats instead of a
single integer \fInum\fR as an argument. In that case, these four
values (which will be automatically normalised) will be used as
single-base background probabilities. If this list is ill-formed, a
flat 0.25 will be assumed, with a warning on stderr.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-ncolours \fInum[,num]\fR
This option takes one, or optionally two (comma-separated), numbers as
arguments.  The first is the maximum total number of colours (distinct
types of motif) being sampled for.  The second applies only when
sampling for cis-regulatory modules (see option \fB\-l\fR) and
specifies the maximum number of colours in one single CRM.  Eg,
\fB\-n\fR \fI10,5\fR specifies that not more than 10 distinct kinds of
motif will be searched for, of which not more than 5 will appear in a
given CRM.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-outputfile \fIfilename\fB
Write output of anneal phasse to \fIfilename\fR. This file contains
the maximal-a-posterior configuration of binding sites that will be
used as a reference state during the tracking phase. If \fIfilename\fR
is "stdout", output is written to standard output instead. The default
filename is "output".
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-wmpriorprob \fInum\fB
The "prior probability" \fIp\fR that a given site on a sequence is a
binding site for a weight matrix.  This is used in two ways: first, if
the length of available sequence is \fIS\fR, PhyloGibbs-MP ensures
that (an integer approximation of) \fIpS\fR sites per sequence are
selected (Note that multi-sequence windows being counted multiply.
Unlike earlier versions of PhyloGibbs, the number of sites is
conserved when running, not the number of windows.  To be meaningful,
therefore, \fIp\fR must be much less than \fI1/m\fR where \fIm\fR is
the motif width (command line option \fB\-m\fR).  When looking for
cis-regulatory modules (option \fB\-l\fR), the length of available
sequence is less than the total length of input sequence.  Second,
when "informative prior" weight matrices are input (option \fB\-M\fR),
this same number is used in calculating, for each window, the prior
probability that it is a sample from these informative prior weight
matrices.  Default: 0.02.
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-nsteps \fInum\fB
Total number of steps in the tracking phase. This is the main option
controlling the total running time of the algorithm. There are
generally four phases to a run of the algorithm: A transient (warmup)
phase, an annealing phase, a deep quench phase, and a tracking
phase. By default the anneal phase is the same length as the tracking
phase, the transient phase is 10% of this length and the deep quench
phase is 3% of this length. The length of all these phases can be
controlled independently with advanced options described
below. Default: 100
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-trackedoutput \fIfilename\fB
File to which posterior probabilities for individual sites and the
estimated weight matrices are written at the end of the tracking phase
(unless this phase is disabled with \fB\-X\fR). The default filename
is "tracked_output".
.PP
.SH ADVANCED OPTIONS
Use these options to fine-tune the working of PhyloGibbs-MP in various
ways. 
.TP
.B \-A , \-\-trackfile \fIfilename\fB
By default PhyloGibbs-MP uses the maximum-a-posterior binding site
configuration found through simulated annealing as a reference state
for the tracking phase. With option \fB-A\fR the algorithm instead
uses the binding site configuration in the file \fIfilename\fR as the
reference state. Each line in \fIfilename\fR specifies a window,
i.e. the location of a binding site, by a set of three white-space
separated integers: the sequence number in the input file (starting
from zero), the start position of the window on that sequence
(starting from zero), and the cluster label number (starting from
one). In case of aligned sequences (\fB\-D\fR), it is sufficient to
give the seq/start pair for one of the aligned sequences. For example,
a file containing
.nf
0  13  1
1  57  1
2  40  1
0  33  2
1  45  2
2  11  2
.fi
specifies two motifs to be tracked: one with sites starting at
positions 13, 57 and 40 on sequences 0, 1, 2, respectively, and the
other with windows starting at 33, 45, 11 on the same
sequences. Specifying \fB\-A\fR skips the simulated anneal and deep
quench phases.
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-blockedfile \fIfilename\fB
Block all windows overlapping sequence stretches specified in
\fIfilename\fR: each line in the file should contain, as
white-space-separated integers, a sequence number (starting from
zero), the starting position on that sequence (starting from zero),
and the number of bases starting at that position to be blocked.  All
windows overlapping those bases will be ignored, i.e. not sampled by
the program.  For example, a file containing
.nf
0 34 5
2 21 6
.fi
specifies that bases 34 through 38 on sequence 0, and bases 21 through
26 on sequence 2, are to be blocked.  Additionally, any occurrence of
a base "x" or "X" in the input sequence is also regarded as a blocked
site.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-rcsymmetric
Assumes the motif weight matrices are
reverse-complement-symmetric. Effectively, the second half of the
weight matrix is assumed to be the reverse-complement of the first
half. If the specified motif width is of odd length, the middle column
is ignored. Default: turned off. This option is not extensively tested.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-discprob \fInum\fB
Perform "discriminative" motif-finding.  This requires several (at least two)
distinct fasta-format files to be input (don't use the obsolete \fB\-f\fR
option: supply the filenames at the end of the commandline).  Each file may
contain one or several sequences, or several groups of aligned sequences
separated by ">>" in the header as described earlier.  Then PhyloGibbs-MP tries
to find motifs that are overrepresented in one input file but are
underrepresented in the others.  Here \fInum\fR is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
that indicates the extent to which a motif occurs discriminatively, that is,
the extent to which it is penalised if it also occurs in other groups.  See the associated paper for more details.
.TP
.B \-E,\-\-trackingcutoff \fIfloat\fB
A cut-off (between 0 and 1) for printing sites in the tracked-output
file: sites with posterior probability less than this value will not
be printed. Default: 0.05.
.TP
.B \-G, \-\-phylohistory \fIvalue\fB
When running on aligned sequences, and assuming a star topology of the
phylogenetic tree, this value is used as a default proximity for all
the species. Thus, when neither \fB-L\fR nor \fB-H\fR are used, the
program assumes the phylogenetic tree is a star topology and that all
species have proximity \fIvalue\fR to the common ancestor. When
\fB-H\fR is used (see below) then proximity \fIvalue\fR is used
whenever there are more sequences in a sequence group than specified
in the \fB-H\fR option. Note that this option is ignored when
\fB-L\fR is used.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-gbrowse \fIfilename\fB
Output annotations for the "anchor species" in GBrowse format.
The anchor species corresponds to the first label in the string
specified with the \fB\-L\fR command-line option.  If \fB\-G\fR or
\fB\-H\fR were used to specify the phylogeny, the anchor 
is assumed to be the first sequence in each sequence group.  The header
for each sequence corresponding to the anchor species must include a
coordinate string of the form "\fIfeature:start..stop\fR" where
\fIfeature\fR could be (for example) a chromosome label and
\fIstart\fR and \fRstop\fR are coordinates.  Eg, "2R:1428500..1429499"
means the input (1000bp) sequence corresponds to bases 1428500 through
1429499 on chromosome 2R.  A set of output files called
\fIfilename_feature.ann\fR are then created containing GBrowse
annotations (eg, \fI\-g dmel\fR with the above example would create
a file \fIdmel_2R.ann\fR).  These can be uploaded to a GBrowse server.
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-phylohistlist \fIvalues\fB
Specifies a phylogenetic tree with star topology for the species from
which the input sequences derive. This option \fBonly\fR applies when:
all groups of aligned sequences have sequences from the same set of
species in the same order. \fIvalues\fR is a comma-separated list (no
spaces) of the proximities (probability of no mutation along branch
from ancestor to leaf) of each species. That is, with \fB-H\fR
\fI0.3,0.2,0.5,0.7\fR, \fI0.3\fR is the proximity of the species from
which the first sequence in the input file derives; \fI0.2\fR, the
proximity of the species of the second sequence; and so on. All
sequences must be covered, otherwise an error occurs.

The same \fIvalues\fR will work if the input has multiple groups of
aligned orthologous sequences and each group has sequences from the
same set of species in the same order.  If the input has multiple
groups of aligned homologous sequences with different species in
different groups, or if the order of the species differs between
groups, then the more general \fB\-L\fR option  needs to be used. 
.TP
.B \-I
Turns off "importance sampling", a running-time optimisation.  Using
this option will cause marginally better results at the expense of a
vastly (about tenfold) greater running time.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-initfile \fIfilename\fB
Name of file containing a configuration of binding sites to be used as
an initial state. This initial configuration will be printed to a file
called initial_output.  File format is similar to the \fB\-A\fR
option, except that a fourth column, specifying the "direction"
(strand) of the window, is required and must be 0 or 1.  For example,
.nf
0  13  1  0
1  57  1  1
.fi  
specifies that windows starting on sequence 0, position 13 and
sequence 1, position 57 should initially be given colour 1, with
directions 0 and 1 respectively (ie, on opposite strands).  See also
\fB\-p\fR. Per default a random initial configuration is used.
.TP
.B \-M \-\-motiffile \fIfilename\fB
Using this option PhyloGibbs-MP can search for sites for
already-characterised transcription factors, i.e. factors for which an
initial weight matrix (perhaps constructed from known binding sites)
is available. \fIfilename\fR contains a set of weight matrices in the
same format as in the output files that PhyloGibbs-MP produces, which is
also the format used by TRANSFAC and MEME.  The width of these WMs
should be at least half the motif width given in option \fB\-m\fR and
not more than twice that width.  These WMs are used to set up
corresponding colours, and to initialise prior probabilities for each
WM for belonging to that colour.  If the number of WMs is equal to or
more than the number of colours specified in the \fB\-n\fR option, the
colours correspond to the first \fIn\fR WMs in this file.  If the
number of colours is greater, the remaining colours are "unbiased" (do
not correspond to a prior WM).  Even if a colour is associated with a
prior WM, this association is only reported in the output if the sites
in this colour match the prior WM significantly.
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-bgpscount \fIvalue\fB
Weigh background probabilities with Markov order greater than zero
with a "pseudocount" of single-site probabilities, with weight
\fIvalue\fR (useful when the input sequence is not long enough to
calculate truly reliable correlated counts but one wants to use them
anyway).  Default: 0.0.  See also the \fB\-N\fR and \fB\-F\fR options.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Run quietly (no output to stdout; errors and warnings are still
printed on stderr.)
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-reverseprint
Print starting positions of sites not from the start of the input
sequences, but as a negative number from the end of input sequences
(ie, the last base on the input sequence is numbered -1).  For
example, this may be the distance from the start of the gene.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-norevcomp
Do not search for reverse-complement matches (ie, do not search on the
"other strand"). Default: Search on both strands.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-nshiftmoves \fInum\fB
Number of global-shift moves per step. In a global-shift move all
windows in a colour are shifted to the left or right by the same
amount. Default: twice the number of colours in the initial configuration.
See also \fB\-w\fR.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print verbose information while running (unlike \fB\-q\fR which
suppresses all output to stdout).  Of \fB\-v\fR and \fB\-q\fR, the
last to be specified applies.
.TP
.B \-W, \-\-write-each-cycle
Write the output and tracked-output (see \fB\-o\fR and \fB\-t\fR)
after every step, instead of just at the end of the anneal and
tracking phases respectively.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-nwinmoves \fInum\fB
Number of window-shift moves per step.  Default: Equal to the total
number of windows in the initial configuration. See also
\fB\-s\fR.
.TP
.B \-X, \-\-noautotrack
Disable tracking: quit after the simulated-anneal and deep quench
phase have finished. The default is to due a tracking phase as well.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-betaincr \fIvalue\fB
Factor by which to increase fictitious inverse temperature (beta) at
each step in the simulated-annealing phase. Must be greater than 1.
Default: 1.2.
.PP
.SH DEPRECATED OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-inputfile \fIfilename\fB
Name of a (single) input sequence file, in fasta or
aligned-fasta format.  Default: none (must be supplied).  This option
is a relic of earlier releases and may be removed in future.  Input files may
now be specified at the end of the command line (or, on systems with
GNU or compatible getopt(), anywhere on the command line), and multiple files
may thus be specified.
.PP
.SH OBSOLETE OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-initialocc \fInums\fB
This used to specify the initial configuration of selected windows and
colours.  See \fB\-p\fR and \fB\-n\fR for the new equivalents.  This
option (without arguments) now turns off importance sampling.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-pseudocount
To reduce command clutter, this is now frozen at the original default
of 1.0, which is arguably the most unbiased choice and seems to work
well.
.TP
.B \-a, \-u, \-g 
These individually controlled lengths of various
phases but, to reduce command clutter, are now all defined as
fractions of the \fB\-S\fR option.  \fB\-g\fR now has a new, unrelated
meaning.
.TP
.B \-c
This specified the number of "colour-change moves" per cycle, which
was zero by default.  This class of moves has been eliminated:
PhyloGibbs-MP runs with a fixed upper-limit number of colours (but
fewer colours may actually be reported) and a fixed number of
predicted sites (specified by the \fB\-p\fR option).
.TP
.B \-p, \-y, \-z
These were used with "colour-change moves" which are now eliminated.
.PP
.SH BUGS
While efforts are made to warn on improper input, improperly formatted
input files (fasta files, blocked-window files, etc) may crash the
program or fail silently with mysterious results.  In particular,
CR-delineated files (old-MacOS-style) will not work; convert them to
Unix-style LF-delineated files.  DOS/Windows-style CR-LF files will
probably work but are not regularly tested.
.PP
The program is sprinkled with asserts that (if compiled with -DDEBUG)
should catch inconsistencies early and terminate execution rather than
fail silently.  If you come across such an assert error, or other
bugs, or have a feature wishlist, send email to the authors,
preferably including the complete commandline, the GSL random number
seed (which are both printed in the output file), and the offending
input file.
