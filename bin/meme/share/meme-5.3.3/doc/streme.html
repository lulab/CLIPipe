        <span class='popt'><b>&lt;primary sequences&gt;</b></span>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>The name of a file containing the primary (positive) sequences in 
          <a href="fasta-format.html">FASTA format</a>.  The file must contain
	  at least two valid sequences or STREME will reject it.
          Note that the command-line version of STREME does not attempt to detect the alphabet
          from the primary sequences, so you should specify it with the
          <span class="popt">--dna</span>, <span class="popt">--rna</span>,
          <span class="popt">--protein</span> or <span class="popt">--alph</span>

      <h3>Output</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
          STREME writes its output to files in a directory named
          <code>streme_out</code>, which it creates if necessary. You can change the
          output directory using the <span class='popt'>--o</span> or <span class='popt'>--oc</span> options.
          The directory will contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href=examples/streme_example_output_files/streme.html><code>streme.html</code></a> -
	    an HTML file that provides the results in an interactive, human-readable format
          <li><a href=examples/streme_example_output_files/streme.txt><code>streme.txt</code></a> -
	    a plain text file of the results
          <li><a href=examples/streme_example_output_files/streme.xml><code>streme.xml</code></a> -
	    an XML file that provides the results in a format designed for machine processing
        </ul>
        
        <p>STREME gives each motif it discovers a <b>name</b>, which is a 
	  <a href=motif-consensus.html>consensus sequence</a>
	  that <i>approximately</i> describes the motif, prefixed by 
          a number from 1 to the number of motifs found, e.g., "1-CCACYAGT".  
          Motif names are intended to be mnemonic only, and are not 
	  intended to be used for searching sequences for matches; to
	  search for matches to STREME motifs, use a STREME output file
          as input to a motif scanning program such as FIMO and MAST.

      <h3>STREME algorithm overview</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>STREME searches for motifs by iterating the following five
	  steps to until the selected stopping criterion is met. The
	  stopping criteria are described in the "Number of Motifs" section, above.
        </p>
	<ol>
	  <li><b>Suffix Tree Creation.</b>
	    <p>
	      STREME builds a single suffix tree that includes both
	      the primary and control sequences (but not the hold-out set
	      sequences).
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Seed Word Evaluation.</b>
	    <p>
	      STREME uses the tree to efficiently
	      evaluate all words of length up the maximum motif width
	      that occur in the primary sequences, computing the 
              <i>p</i>-value of each such word's relative enrichment 
	      in the primary sequences using the chosen objective function. 
	      (Note: With the Differential Enrichment objective function,
	      STREME will use the Binomial test instead of Fisher's exact test 
              if the primary and control sequences have different average 
              lengths.  With the Central Distance objective function, 
              STREME computes
	      the cumulative Bates distribution of the average distances of
	      the seed word from the centers of the sequences.)
	    </p>
	  </li> 
	  <li><b>Motif Refinement.</b>
	    <p>
	      STREME converts each of the best seed words into a motif,
	      and iteratively refines each motif, selecting the motif that
	      best discriminates the primary sequences from the control sequences.
	      At each iteration of refinement, the current motif and the (k-1)-order 
	      background are used with the suffix tree to efficiently find the best 
	      site in each sequence.  The primary and control sequences are then sorted
	      by the log-likelihood score of their best site, and the score threshold
	      that optimizes the <i>p</i>-value of the statistical test
	      (which depends on the chosen objective function) is found.
	      The iteration ends by estimating a new version of the motif
	      from the single best site in each primary sequence whose
	      score is above the optimal threshold.  This new motif is 
	      used in the next refinement iteration.  Refinement stops
	      when the <i>p</i>-value fails to improve or the maximum 
	      allowed number of iterations (20) have been performed.
	    </p>
	  </li> 
	  <li><b>Motif Significance Computation.</b>
	    <p>
	      STREME computes the unbiased statistical significance of the of
	      the motif by using the motif and the optimal discriminative score threshold (based on the
	      primary and control sequences) to classify the hold-out set sequences,
	      and then applying the statistical test (Fisher's exact test, Binomial test,
	      or the cumulative Bates distribution) to the classification.
	      Classification is based on the best match to the motif in each
	      sequence (on either strand when the alphabet is complementable).
	    </p>
	  </li> 
	  <li><b>Motif Erasing.</b>
	    <p>
	      STREME "erases" each of the sites of the best motif
	      from both the primary and control sequences by converting the sites
	      to the separator character.  Only the positions in the site
              where the letter has a positive likelihood ratio are erased to
	      allow some overlap of sites of different motifs.

      <h3 id="running_time">STREME Running time and memory usage</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>
	  The running time and memory usage of STREME depends on the total size of the sequences
	  in its input, the length of the sequences, the alphabet of the sequences
	  and the minimum and maximum motif widths.  The following tables show the
	  running times and memory usage for STREME on on different size datasets (of random sequences),
	  as a function of the length of the sequences, on a 3.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor 
	  with 16GB of memory.  STREME was run using a single thread, and the motif
	  width was the maximum allowed range: minimum = 5, maximum = 30.
          The total sizes of the sequences in the datasets from 
          100,000 (1 x 10<sup>5</sup>) to 20,000,000 (2 x 10<sup>7</sup>).
        </p>
        <p>
          With very short sequences (length = 5), STREME is extremely fast, processing
	  4,000,000 DNA sequences in less than 100 seconds. The running time increases with
          sequence length, reaching a maximum for sequences around 30 long.
          With very long sequences, STREME is runs more quickly, with length 10,000
	  sequences taking approximately the same time per motif discovered as length 10 sequences.
	  STREME runs about twice as slow on DNA sequences as on RNA sequences because
          STREME treats DNA sequences as double-stranded and RNA sequences as single-stranded.
	  Because of the larger alphabet size, STREME runs about 5 times more slowly
	  on protein sequences than on RNA sequences, which is the same factor
	  as the ratio of the alphabet sizes (20/4).  The running time of STREME with
	  sequences over a custom alphabet will similarly be (roughly) proportional to the
	  number of letters in the custom alphabet.
